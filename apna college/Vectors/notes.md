# Vectors
- Vectors is a data structure which is very array like we also have indixes like arrays only difference beetween array and vectors that the vector are dynamic in nature 
- Vector syntax 
    - vector <<type of vector>int,char,float> vector_name;
    - upar wale vector ka abhi size 0 hoga kyuki humne kuch declare nhi kiya hai value
    - vector also can be declared as vector <<vector_type>,int char,float> vector_name = vector_value;
    - in vector we use for each loop instead of normal for loop to print all the values of a vector 

- Vector function
    - Size
    - Push_back
    - Pop_back
    - front
    - back 
    - at
    - erase
    - insert 
    - clear
    - empty
- vector memory can allocated during runtime and it is dynamically in a heap
